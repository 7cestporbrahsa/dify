## Method 1: Run a System File Checker (SFC) Scan

`  `
`
`1. Press Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) from the menu.
`
`2. Type sfc /scannow and press Enter.
`

`

`
`5. Restart your PC and try to open the EPUB file again.
`
`
`  `
## Method 2: Reinstall the Program or Application Causing the Error
`  `
If the error occurs when you try to open an EPUB file with a specific program or application, such as Adobe Digital Editions or Calibre, it may be due to a faulty installation or an outdated version of the program.
