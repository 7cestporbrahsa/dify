One of the most distinctive features of Cantik Itu Luka is its use of magical realism, a literary technique that blends realistic and fantastical elements. For example, Dewi Ayu rises from her grave after being dead for 21 years, a tiger becomes a human lover, and a soldier survives being shot in the head. These elements create a sense of wonder and mystery, but also reflect the absurdity and brutality of the historical events that shape the lives of the characters.
 
Another notable aspect of the novel is its portrayal of women, who are often subjected to violence, oppression, and exploitation by men. Dewi Ayu and her daughters suffer from rape, incest, abuse, and murder, but they also show resilience, courage, and agency. They challenge the patriarchal norms and expectations of their society, and assert their own desires and identities. The novel also explores the diversity and complexity of Indonesian women, who come from different ethnicities, religions, and backgrounds.
 
Cantik Itu Luka is a novel that offers a rich and captivating glimpse into Indonesian culture and history, as well as a powerful and provocative commentary on human nature. It is a novel that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a novel that you will not forget.
